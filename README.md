AudioViz Studio

Advanced Digital Audio Signal Processing and Visualization Tool

Overview

AudioViz Studio is an open-source project that bridges the gap between theoretical audio signal processing and its practical applications. Built with Python, this tool provides a hands-on experience for users to manipulate, analyze, and visualize audio signals in real-time. It incorporates a variety of powerful features and showcases the capabilities of digital signal processing through an intuitive graphical interface.

Features

Audio Visualization

Spectrograms: Real-time visualization of frequency components in audio.

VU Meter: Dynamic level monitoring with logarithmic scaling for precise amplitude representation.

Frequency Domain Analysis: Detailed breakdown of frequency characteristics using FFT.

Audio Effects

Equalizer: Multi-band frequency control for precise audio tuning.

Reverb and Echo/Delay: Adds spatial effects for immersive soundscapes.

Pitch Shifting: Real-time alteration of audio pitch.

Playback Features

Play, pause, restart, and fast-forward options.

Adjustable volume control for fine-tuned listening.

Integration

Fully compatible with OBS Studio via virtual audio cable integration for live audio visualization.

Mathematical Foundations

Implements:

Fourier Transform for frequency domain processing.

Convolution and Impulse Response for time-domain effects.

Sampling and frequency band analysis.
